# Multi-Agent Architecture Backbone Implementation Plan

## Overview
This file tracks the implementation plan, progress, and deviations for building the backbone of the Air Quality Q&A Agent's multi-agent architecture, starting with the Location Resolver Agent.

---

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Project Structure Setup
- [ ] Ensure required folders exist: `src/agents/`, `src/graphs/`, `src/utils/`, `src/api/`, `tests/`, `logs/`, `docs/`, `config/`.
- [ ] Create and maintain this plan file: `docs/implementation_progress.md`.
- [ ] Create and maintain a project README: `README.md`.

### 2. Define Agent Interfaces
- [ ] Create a base agent interface/class in `src/agents/agent_base.py`.
    - Standardize input/output formats.
    - Include logging and error handling hooks.

### 3. Implement Location Resolver Agent
- [ ] Create `src/agents/location_resolver.py`.
    - Input: location string (city, landmark, alias, etc.)
    - Output: standardized location IDs, coordinates, confidence, bounding box.
    - Use mock data for initial implementation; plan for DB integration.

### 4. Integrate with Orchestrator/Graph
- [ ] Update or create `src/graphs/multi_agent_graph.py`.
    - Add node for Location Resolver Agent.
    - Define state structure for agent communication.

### 5. Testing & Validation
- [ ] Add unit tests in `tests/test_location_resolver.py`.
- [ ] Test with sample queries and edge cases.

### 6. Progress Tracking
- [ ] Update this file after each step:
    - What was completed.
    - Any deviations from the plan.
    - Issues encountered and solutions.

### 7. Next Steps
- [ ] After Location Resolver Agent: plan for Temporal Parser Agent, Data Agents, etc.
- [ ] Continue updating the progress file.

## Progress Log

*21 Sep 2025*: Plan file created.
*21 Sep 2025*: Base agent interface (`src/agents/agent_base.py`) and Location Resolver Agent skeleton (`src/agents/location_resolver.py`) created. Unit tests scaffolded in `tests/test_location_resolver.py`. Next: validate tests and expand agent logic as needed.

## Deviations & Notes

No deviations so far. Note: `pytest` not installed yet; will need to install before running tests.
